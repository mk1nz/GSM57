# Build instructions

1 - Cut speaker cabinet parts using CNC router.
IMPORTANT: The area between circles on the baffle needs to be carved using CNC by 3mm.
WARNING: СNC drawings NOT include chamfers. Type and chamfer style at the discretion of the DIYer.

2 - Glue speaker cabinet parts together.
SUGGESTION: Use medium drying adhesive

3 - Prepare and glue the port to the speaker cabinet.
Port length: 83.27mm
Port diameter: 24.6mm

4 - Solder Belden 1307A 16AWG cable directly to the speaker and Amplenol SP-2-MD speaker connector.
SUGGESTION: The length of the cable should be short to prevent parasitic vibrations inside the speaker cabinet.

5 - Fasten the speaker and speaker connector to the cabinet.
